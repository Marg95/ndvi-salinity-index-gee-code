# NDVI and Salinity Index Analysis using Google Earth Engine

## Project Overview

This project develops a geospatial workflow using Google Earth Engine to monitor vegetation health and soil salinity dynamics in northeastern Argentina through multi-temporal satellite analysis.

The workflow integrates Sentinel-2 Harmonized imagery to generate NDVI and SI2 indices, allowing identification of spatial patterns potentially associated with land degradation and agricultural productivity constraints.

## Business / Territorial Value

The methodology supports:

- Detection of vegetation stress patterns  
- Identification of areas potentially affected by soil salinization  
- Monitoring environmental changes over time  
- Generation of indicators useful for territorial planning and agricultural management  

---

## Methodology

The workflow includes:

- Satellite data acquisition from Sentinel-2 Harmonized Collection  
- Cloud masking and reflectance preprocessing  
- NDVI and SI2 index calculation  
- Multi-temporal analysis using time series charts  
- Spatial filtering using user-defined shapefiles

## Technologies Used

- Google Earth Engine (JavaScript API)  
- Sentinel-2 Harmonized dataset  
- Remote sensing spectral indices  
- Geospatial data processing and visualization

## How to Use

1. Copy the script into the Google Earth Engine platform.  
2. Upload your own shapefile or define a custom polygon as Area of Interest (AOI).  
3. Run the script to generate indices and time series charts.
